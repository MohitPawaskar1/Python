'''
    The walrus operator (:=) in Python is used for assignment expressions. 
    
    It allows you to assign a value to a variable inside an expression, making the code more concise.

if (n := len([1,2,3,4,5])) > 3:
    print(f"List is too long ({n} elements, expected <= 3)")


while (value := input("Enter something: ")) != "exit":
    print(f"You entered: {value}")
