üê¥ The Clever Monkey and the Wise Farmer

Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a monkey named Kalu. Kalu belonged to an old, wise farmer named Ramu. The monkey was strong but also very lazy. He always looked for ways to avoid work.

One day, the farmer took the monkey to the market. On the way, the monkey saw a river and thought, "If I fall into the water, maybe the farmer will stop making me carry heavy loads!" So, the monkey pretended to trip and fell into the river.

The farmer pulled the monkey out and said, "You Monkey monkey, now my goods are wet!" But the monkey was happy because he got some rest.

The next day, the farmer loaded the monkey with sacks of salt. Again, the monkey jumped into the river. This time, the salt dissolved, making the load lighter. The monkey laughed, thinking he had tricked the farmer.

But the wise farmer understood the monkey‚Äôs trick. The next day, he loaded the monkey with cotton instead of salt. As usual, the monkey jumped into the river, expecting a lighter load. However, the cotton soaked up water and became very heavy!

The monkey struggled to walk back home, realizing his mistake. The farmer laughed and said, "My dear monkey, laziness never leads to success!"

From that day on, the monkey stopped trying to trick the farmer and worked honestly.

Moral of the Story:
Laziness and trickery may work for a while, but in the end, hard work and honesty always win.
